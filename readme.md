# The Problem
Since, every year there are millions of applicants who apply for jobs/internships, but there is no one-stop platform for these opportunites. 
Currently there are many different portals for every state/union government organizations, where jobs were posted. It will make process of 
finding suitable jobs/internships very cumbersome and difficult for candidates.

And for comapanies/startups, it will become a hard time finding all  suitable candidates, from differnt portals and platforms. Therefore we have come up with a one-stop solution for all this hustle.

# Our Solution
This is a one-stop platform for job seekers to find suitable jobs/internships and for companies/startups to post their job opportunities. This platform
acts like a interface for companies and candidates across the nation. 

From this one website, all the aspiring candidates will get the opportunity and experience to know about some different scalable startups of different
levels and domains. By this platform, startups can find suitable candidates to work with them from pan India and expand their startup community.

The platform is made in a very understandable design and layout with very minimalistic and functional features with no extra content bothering around.

### Technology Stack Used:

* NodeJS​
* MongoDB​
* Passport.js
* Bootstrap​
* HTML, CSS, and JS

### Project Scalability/Future Plans:
We are trying to make this site faster and better using other technologies. 
In near future we are planning to:
1. Make this platform responsive.
2. To add support of Hindi language .
3. Colour theme according to people having color-blindness.
4. On matching a job-seeker’s criteria with an available job, a notification may be sent to the job-seeker. Upon confirmation, the aspirant's job application may be automatically sent to the organization having the vacancy. 
5. To complete, all the remaining features mentioned on the website.
6. We are planning to provide certification courses.
